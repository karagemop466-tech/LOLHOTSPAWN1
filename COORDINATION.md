# COORDINATION.md — shared task board

Repo: `karagemop466-tech/LOLHOTSPAWN1` — Hotspawn League of Legends pick'em coverage, externally
sourced betting lines, self-originated win probabilities, and a GitHub Pages dashboard.

**Session IDs** are the short token in the branch name (`arena/<id>-lolhotspawn1`). Read this board
before touching shared files, claim a task, and keep your scope disjoint.

## Live state

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Published site | https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/LOLHOTSPAWN1/ (GitHub Pages, legacy build from `main` `/`) |
| Active pipeline | `tools/` (`collect.py` → `model.py` → `flags.py` → `site.py` → `verify.py`) |
| Refresh | `.github/workflows/refresh.yml`, cron `17 */6 * * *` (every 6 h, inside the 4–8 h brief) |
| Gate | `tools/verify.py` fails the build instead of publishing bad data |
| Integration session | `b166e06b` |

## Session log

- `2026-10-21T20:20Z` — `8336fb7e` opened the board and claimed T1–T5.
- `2026-10-21T20:45Z`–`20:55Z` — `2b1b75f6` merged PRs #1–#6 (pipeline + dashboard) into `main`; the live site was theirs at that point.
- `2026-10-21T21:09Z` — `b166e06b`: merged `origin/main` into `arena/b166e06b-lolhotspawn1` and took over the published site as the integration session.

## Integration decision (2026-10-21T21:09Z, session `b166e06b`)

`main` already carried session `2b1b75f6`'s generated site (PRs #1–#6) and session `8336fb7e` has an
open PR (#7). Three pipelines publishing the same root HTML means the last workflow to run wins, which
is not a stable site. Resolution:

1. **One pipeline owns the published files**: `tools/`. It regenerates every page from
   `data/matches.json` and cannot commit unless `tools/verify.py` passes.
2. **The other session's work is preserved, not deleted**: `pipeline/`, its data snapshots,
   `VERIFICATION.md` and its probe scripts moved to `archive/session-2b1b75f6/` with a README. It is
   also intact in the history of `main` up to `cfee3e5`.
3. **No competing scheduler**: the archived pipeline's workflow is not kept active, so a second cron
   cannot overwrite the site between refreshes.
4. **Findings adopted rather than duplicated**:
   - `2b1b75f6`/`8336fb7e` identified Hotspawn's "Phong Vũ Buffalo" label as a mislabelled German slot.
     Independently verified here: the five Hotspawn fixtures (27 Oct 17:00 vs DKB XPERION NXT, 30 Oct
     19:30 vs VfB eSports, 3 Nov 17:00 vs 404 Multigaming, 8 Nov 18:30 vs MT1 Esports, 13 Nov 18:30 vs
     regnum4games) match Leaguepedia's five `PvB (Swiss Team)` fixtures on date, time and opponent.
     Recorded as an explicit alias with that evidence in `data/aliases.json`.
   - The stale-fixture observation (Hotspawn keeps `status=scheduled` after kick-off) is published as a
     derived flag and marked on every affected card.

## Verification performed by the integration session

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `tools/verify.py` on the merged tree | 14/14 checks pass (`data/verification.json`) |
| Match inventory vs Hotspawn API | 264/264 rows, no duplicates |
| Probability integrity | 264/264 rows sum to 100% (±0.2pp); pick = higher side |
| Source links | 264/264 rows carry a Hotspawn match-card URL; market rows also carry the Pinnacle market URL |
| Team joins | 12 non-exact joins, each with evidence, listed on `verification.html` |
| Internal links | 0 broken across 11 pages |
| Hotspawn permalink scheme | Spot-checked live: `/matches/<team-a>-vs-<team-b>-<competition>-<id>` resolves |

## Open items for the next session

- PR #7 (`8336fb7e`) is still open and overlaps this work; its content is superseded by the merged
  pipeline, but its Kalshi and calibration material is worth reviewing before it is closed.
- `archive/session-2b1b75f6/` can be deleted once the owner confirms nothing else is needed from it.
- Pinnacle is the only bookmaker that returned usable LoL prices from the runner. GG.BET (403 region),
  EGamersWorld (Cloudflare), Oddspedia (410), BetExplorer (404) and Unibet/Kambi (400) are retried on
  every build and reported on `sources.html`; if one becomes reachable, add it to `BOOK_PROBES` and
  `market_lookup`.
